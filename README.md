# CAR STATUS  - Gabrielli George Stefan (ggie1905)

Car status is an application that lets you add all of your car expenses, such as insurance, road taxes and maintenance costs.

Each user will have a collection of cars that he owns.

For each car, the user can add a insurance, road tax, and also other expenses such as gas, winshield fluid, and so on.

If the insurance, or the road tax will expire, the user will receive a notification telling him that it will expire.


- owner: - has the right to manage all of his expenses and cars(add car , remove car)
          - manages his drivers( assign a car to a driver, hire and fire a driver)
          
- driver: has only the right to see the cars that he drives currently, and see an overview about the car status(e.g. when the insurance will expire)
